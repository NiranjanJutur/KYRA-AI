## üìù **Coding Standards**

### **Python Code Style**
- Follow PEP 8 guidelines
- Use type hints where appropriate
- Maximum line length: 88 characters (black formatter)
- Use meaningful variable and function names

### **Django Best Practices**
- Follow Django coding style
- Use class-based views when appropriate
- Implement proper error handling
- Use Django forms for data validation

### **Code Organization**
- Keep functions and classes focused
- Use meaningful docstrings
- Organize imports properly
- Separate business logic from views

### **Example Code Structure**
```python
"""
Module for handling PDF document operations.

This module provides functionality for uploading, processing,
and summarizing PDF documents using various AI models.
"""

from typing import Dict, List, Optional
from django.core.exceptions import ValidationError
from .models import PDFDocument
from .utils import extract_text_from_pdf


def process_pdf_document(pdf_file, user) -> Dict[str, str]:
    """
    Process a PDF document and generate summaries.
    
    Args:
        pdf_file: Uploaded PDF file
        user: User who uploaded the file
        
    Returns:
        Dictionary containing summary results
        
    Raises:
        ValidationError: If file processing fails
    """
    try:
        # Extract text from PDF
        text_content = extract_text_from_pdf(pdf_file)
        
        # Generate summaries
        summaries = generate_summaries(text_content)
        
        return summaries
        
    except Exception as e:
        raise ValidationError(f"Failed to process PDF: {str(e)}")
```

## üß™ **Testing Guidelines**

### **Test Structure**

def test_extract_text_from_pdf_success():
    """Test successful text extraction from PDF."""
    pass

def test_extract_text_from_pdf_invalid_file():
    """Test text extraction with invalid file format."""
    pass

def test_extract_text_from_pdf_empty_file():
    """Test text extraction with empty PDF file."""
    pass
```

### **Running Tests**
```bash
# Run all tests
python manage.py test

# Run specific test file
